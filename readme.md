King Shan is the emperor and has been ruling for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu you see)!

Here we have mapped Shan family tree so that when given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’ as an input, the output are the people that correspond to the relationship.

Steps to get started:

ruby family_tree.rb

Requirements:

Ruby 2.x
